# Yianni Mercer's Portfolio

## Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio!  

## Who am I?
My name is Yianni Mercer and I am senior at DePaul University studying mathemtaics, and data science.  Throughout my time in University I have obtained countless hours of expererience in statisitcal modeling, and data science pipelining (i.e., data collection, cleaning, engineering, and modeling). 

As I approach the end of my academic career, I hope to gain a full time opportunity as a Data Scientist.  My passion lies within sport analystics, however I am open to any opportunity that will allow me to advace my skils within the data science field.  

Feel free to peruse the rest of portfolio where you can find my resume and featured proejcts that showcase my data science and analytical skills.

## Featured Projects  TEST

### [Analysis of COVID-19 in Chicago](https://github.com/yiannimercer/COVID19_Chicago_Analysis)
This project aims to analyze COVID-19's affect on the City of Chicago through different categories of citizens, such as age groups, gender (if-applicable), and race/ethnicity. A project of this type can be used to study how a global pandemic affects the groups of citizens of a city like Chicago and if something similar were to happen, we can be better prepared to combat the deadly virus against our most at risk citizens.

### [Estimating the Salary of a Data Scientist](https://github.com/yiannimercer/ds_salary_estimator_proj)
In this project I created a tool that estmates data science salaries (MAE ~ $ 24K) to help data scientists negotitate their income when they get a job. In order to do this, I scraped over 1000 job descriptions from glassdoor using python and selenium.  In turn, I engineered features from the text of each job description to quantify the value companies put on skills such as, python, excel, aws, and spark.  The modeling building phased consisted of optimizing Linear, LASSO, and Random Forest Regressors using GridsearchCV to reach the best model. In th eend, I built a client facing API using flask, in order to productionize this effort.
