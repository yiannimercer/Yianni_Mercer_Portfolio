# Yianni Mercer's Portfolio

## Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio!

## Who am I?
My name is Yianni Mercer and I am senior at DePaul University studying mathemtaics, and data science.  Throughout my time in University I have obtained countless hours of expererience in statisitcal modeling, and data science pipelining (i.e., data collection, cleaning, engineering, and modeling). 

As I approach the end of my academic career, I hope to gain a full time opportunity as a Data Scientist.  My passion lies within sport analystics, however I am open to any opportunity that will allow me to advace my skils within the data science field.  

Feel free to peruse the rest of portfolio where you can find my resume and featured proejcts that showcase my data science and analytical skills.
